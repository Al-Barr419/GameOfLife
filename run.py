#
# Build an example full theory for your setting and return it.
#
#  There should be at least 10 variables, and a sufficiently large formula to describe it (>50 operators).
#  This restriction is fairly minimal, and if there is any concern, reach out to the teaching staff to clarify
#  what the expectations are.
