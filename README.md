# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to the major project for CISC/CMPE 204 (Fall 2020)!

Change this README.md file to summarize your project (few sentences at most), and provide pointers to the general structure of the repository. How you organize and build things (which files, how you structure things, etc) is entirely up to you! The only things you must keep in place are what is already listed in the **Structure** section below.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: You can safely ignore this, but keep it in your repository. It will be used for "auto grading" the project, which essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
