# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to the major project for CISC/CMPE 204!

Change this README.md file to summarize your project, and provide pointers to the general structure of the repository. How you organize and build things (which files, how you structure things, etc) is entirely up to you! The only things you must keep in place are what is already listed in the **Structure** section below.

## Structure


* `documents`: Contains all the files for the draft and final submissions. 
* `visualizer.py`: Helper python file in order to create a visual representation in the terminal. 
* `currentRun.py`: Main running function, contains all the propositions and constraints. 
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
* `Dockerfile`: Unedited Dockerfile used to create the Docker Image.
